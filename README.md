# 🐍 Introduction to Python – Hello & Temperature Program

This is my **first Python project**, created as part of the **Introduction to Programming Concepts** course at **Valencia College (Dual Enrollment)**.

## 📋 Project Overview

This simple Python program helps beginners understand:
- How to **print output** to the screen
- How to **receive user input**
- How to **concatenate strings** and variables

The program prints a welcome message, asks the user for the current temperature, and responds with a message using their input.

## 💡 Features

- Outputs: `"Hello World"`
- Takes user input: `"What is the current temperature?"`
- Displays the message: `"The current temperature is ___."`

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How Python handles strings and variables
- How to interact with users through input and output
- How to run and test Python code in a local IDE

## 📂 File

- `Hello.py` – contains all the code for this program
